Almost two years back, Nvidia published PilotNet paper demonstrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) for self-driving cars in an end-to-end approach. In this post, I want to present how I used that architecture to predict steering wheel axis for a vehicle inside a game. I have formulated steering angle prediction as a regression problem.
