**Software Developer, Jumbotail, Bangalore (Aug, 16 - Present)**

At Jumbotail, I have been handling complete product lifecycle of main customer app. Have designed and built asynchronous offline framework with periodic server sync for android apps for data consistency, including pending file uploads, across multiple sessions, process kill, crashes. Built asynchronous cart, dynamic browse, offers and improved Push notification delivery from 55% to 70%.
Also part of the recruiting team, built team of 14 engineers over the span of ~2 years.
Initiated machine learning based projects and build ConvNet based Image Classifier for searching/categorizing non-barcoded SKUs.


**Software Developer (Android), Roposo, Gurgaon (Jan, 16 - Jul, 16)**

At Roposo, I built module to center faces in the feed for better engagement. Also migrated async tasks to thread pools and handler thread to make to memory and time efficient.
Built framework to download images in background while connected to WiFi which saved bandwidth and battery of the user while browsing over mobile network.


**Software Developer (Android), Housing.com, Mumbai (Jul, 15 - Dec, 15)**

At housing.com, I built supply module for onboarding new properties. Along with that worked on several memory, network optimiziation for the main Housing Android app.
