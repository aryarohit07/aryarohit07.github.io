**Software Developer (Android), Roposo, Gurgaon (Jan, 16 - Jul, 16)**

At Roposo, I built module to center faces in the feed for better engagement. Also migrated async tasks to thread pools and handler thread to make to memory and time efficient.
Built framework to download images in background while connected to WiFi which saved bandwidth and battery of the user while browsing over mobile network.

**Software Developer (Android), Housing.com, Mumbai (Jul, 15 - Dec, 15)**

At housing.com, I built supply module for onboarding new properties. Along with that worked on several memory, network optimiziation for the main Housing Android app.
