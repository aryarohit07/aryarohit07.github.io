title: About me
---

Hi, I am a Software Engineer at Jumbotail, Bengaluru. I did mine under graduation in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi). Prior to Jumbotail, I have worked at Roposo, Gurugram and Housing, Mumbai.

I am interested in Machine Learning (particularly Deep Learning).

In my free time, I write [blogs on Medium](https://medium.com/@rohitarya/latest), maintain some open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/aryarohit07) and try to contribute on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2720553/rohit-arya).
